# Welcome to my first Python GitHub project!
# Get ready to laugh and enjoy the world of coding with a touch of humor.
# This script will not only greet you but also help you come up with an awesome band name.
# Because let's be honest, every coder secretly dreams of becoming a rockstar, right? ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ¸

# Prepare yourself for the Band Name Generator - the only tool you'll need to achieve your musical dreams!
# Just kidding, you'll still need talent, instruments, and a band... but hey, at least you'll have a cool name!

# Start your engines... I mean, start your code!

# Print a greeting message that includes the user's name
# The input function prompts the user to enter their name, which is then concatenated with "Hello " and "!"
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")

# Welcome message for the Band Name Generator
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")

# Prompt the user to enter the name of the city they grew up in and store it in the variable 'street'
street = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

# Prompt the user to enter their pet's name and store it in the variable 'pet'
pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")

# Combine the values of 'street' and 'pet' to generate a band name and print it
print("Your band name could be " + street + " " + pet)
